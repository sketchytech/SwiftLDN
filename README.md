# SwiftLDN
This is the playground for the [practicals meetup on 20 July 2016](http://www.meetup.com/swiftlondon/events/232251726/). It contains a series of exercises that we'll work together to complete. Please download but don't worry beforehand about how you are going to complete the exercises. We'll be doing them together at the meetup.

The meetup will focus on exploring byte representation including Base64. This sounds like it might be a difficult subject but we'll move slowly and there are challenges here for all abilities from those who are uncomfortable thinking about bits and bytes to those who can't get enough of them. By the end of the practical fears will be overcome and the basics of working with bytes will be second nature (hopefully!).
